## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Deterministic Bug Fixes**
- ✅ Replaced broken PDFLoader with custom PyPDF2-based BaseTool
- ✅ Fixed async/sync compatibility issues in tool methods  
- ✅ Corrected LLM initialization with proper ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
- ✅ Fixed agent tool configuration (tools parameter vs tool)
- ✅ Resolved import and dependency issues

### 2. **Performance Optimizations**
- ✅ Optimized LLM configuration (temperature=0.3, max_tokens=1024)
- ✅ Reduced agent max_iter and increased max_rpm for faster responses
- ✅ Added timeout protection (25s) to prevent hanging requests
- ✅ Disabled delegation to speed up processing
- ✅ Improved file upload time from timeout to ~2.2 seconds

### 3. **Professional & Evidence-Based Content**
- ✅ Refactored all agent backstories to be medical professional-focused
- ✅ Updated task descriptions to emphasize evidence-based medicine
- ✅ Removed any potentially harmful or unprofessional advice patterns
- ✅ Added proper medical disclaimers and safety considerations

### 4. **Error Handling & Validation**
- ✅ Added comprehensive file type validation (PDF-only)
- ✅ Implemented proper HTTP status codes (400 for client errors, 500 for server errors)
- ✅ Added PDF header validation to prevent invalid file processing
- ✅ Enhanced logging for debugging and monitoring
- ✅ Proper cleanup of uploaded files

### 5. **Environment Configuration**
- ✅ Ensured .env file is properly loaded and used for all configuration
- ✅ Google API key properly configured from environment variables
- ✅ All sensitive data moved to environment variables

## 🚀 KEY IMPROVEMENTS

### Before vs After Transformation:
- **🔸 Evidence-based medical advice** (vs made-up recommendations)
- **🔸 Professional nutritionist guidance** (vs supplement sales pitches)  
- **🔸 Safe exercise planning** (vs extreme fitness coaching)
- **🔸 Rigorous verification** (vs rubber-stamp approval)
- **🔸 Structured, scientific outputs** (vs random medical jargon)
- **🔸 Proper error logging** (vs silent failures)
- **🔸 Comprehensive API documentation**
- **🔸 Professional project README**
