Project To-Do List: Blood Test Analysis System Debugging
This document outlines the step-by-step actions required to fix deterministic bugs and optimize inefficient prompts within the CrewAI blood test analysis system.

1. Initial Setup & Verification
[ ] Clone the project repository.

[ ] Create a new Python virtual environment.

[ ] Install all dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.

[ ] Ensure GOOGLE_API_KEY is correctly set as an environment variable or loaded via a .env file.

[ ] Run the FastAPI application: uvicorn main:app --reload.

[ ] Perform initial testing of the /analyze endpoint with sample.pdf and blood_test_report.pdf to observe current behavior and identify immediate errors.

2. Deterministic Bug Fixes
2.1. tools.py - PDFLoader Import
[ ] Open tools.py.

[ ] Add the following import statement at the top of the file:

from crewai_tools import PDFLoader

2.2. tools.py - Asynchronous Tool Methods
[ ] Open tools.py.

[ ] Locate the read_data_tool method within BloodTestReportTool.

[ ] Remove the async keyword from its definition.

Before: async def read_data_tool(path='data/sample.pdf'):

After: def read_data_tool(path='data/sample.pdf'):

[ ] Locate the analyze_nutrition_tool method within NutritionTool.

[ ] Remove the async keyword from its definition.

Before: async def analyze_nutrition_tool(blood_report_data):

After: def analyze_nutrition_tool(blood_report_data):

[ ] Locate the create_exercise_plan_tool method within ExerciseTool.

[ ] Remove the async keyword from its definition.

Before: async def create_exercise_plan_tool(blood_report_data):

After: def create_exercise_plan_tool(blood_report_data):

2.3. LLM Initialization
[ ] Open agents.py.

[ ] Locate the line llm = llm.

[ ] Replace it with a proper LLM initialization. Example using langchain_google_genai:

from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-pro", verbose=True, temperature=0.1)

[ ] Remove the llm = llm line from main.py if it exists there, as the LLM should be initialized once in agents.py and imported.

2.4. agents.py - Agent Tool Parameter
[ ] Open tools.py.

[ ] Locate the read_data_tool method within BloodTestReportTool.

[ ] Add the @staticmethod decorator above its definition.

Before:

# ...
def read_data_tool(path='data/sample.pdf'):
# ...

After:

# ...
@staticmethod
def read_data_tool(path='data/sample.pdf'):
# ...

[ ] Open agents.py.

[ ] Locate the doctor agent definition.

[ ] Change tool=[BloodTestReportTool().read_data_tool] to tools=[BloodTestReportTool.read_data_tool].

Before: tool=[BloodTestReportTool().read_data_tool],

After: tools=[BloodTestReportTool.read_data_tool],

2.5. task.py - Task Tool References
[ ] Open task.py.

[ ] Verify that all tasks referencing BloodTestReportTool.read_data_tool are correctly using tools=[BloodTestReportTool.read_data_tool] (which should be correct after step 2.4).

3. Inefficient Prompt Optimization
3.1. agents.py - Agent Backstories and Goals
[ ] Open agents.py.

[ ] Doctor Agent:

[ ] Update goal: "Provide accurate and comprehensive medical advice based on blood test reports and relevant medical knowledge."

[ ] Update expected_output: "A clear verification status indicating whether the file is a valid blood test report. If valid, confirm its readability and relevance. If not, state the reason and suggest the appropriate file type. Include details like 'File confirmed as valid blood test report: [filename]' or 'File not a valid blood test report: [reason]'."

4. Code Refactoring and Best Practices
4.1. main.py - Error Handling and Cleanup
[ ] Open main.py.

[ ] Locate the finally block within the analyze_blood_report function.

[ ] Modify the except block for os.remove to log the error instead of pass.

Before:

# ...
    try:
        os.remove(file_path)
    except:
        pass  # Ignore cleanup errors

After:

# ...
    try:
        os.remove(file_path)
    except Exception as cleanup_e:
        print(f"Warning: Could not delete file {file_path}: {cleanup_e}")

4.2. General Code Structure and Readability
[ ] Review all Python files (agents.py, main.py, task.py, tools.py).

[ ] Ensure consistent indentation (e.g., 4 spaces).

[ ] Add comments for complex logic, function headers, and non-obvious parts of the code.

[ ] Consider using f-strings for string formatting where appropriate.

5. README.md Documentation Update
[ ] Open README.md.

[ ] Remove the "You're All Not Set! üêõ Debug Mode Activated!" section.

[ ] Update the document with the following sections and content:

[ ] Project Title: A clear and descriptive title (e.g., "AI-Powered Blood Test Analysis System").

[ ] Overview: A brief explanation of the system's purpose.

[ ] Features: List the key functionalities (e.g., "Blood test report analysis," "Personalized health recommendations").

[ ] Getting Started:

[ ] Instructions for cloning the repository.

[ ] Steps to create and activate a Python virtual environment.

[ ] Command to install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt).

[ ] Instructions on setting the GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable.

[ ] Command to run the FastAPI application (uvicorn main:app --reload).

[ ] API Documentation:

[ ] Endpoint: /analyze (POST request).

[ ] Parameters: file (UploadFile, required), query (Form, optional).

[ ] Example usage using curl or Postman.

[ ] Description of the expected JSON response format.

[ ] Bugs Found and Fixes Implemented:

[ ] Create subsections for "Deterministic Bugs" and "Inefficient Prompts."

[ ] For each bug, describe the original issue and the specific code change made to fix it.

[ ] For prompt optimizations, show examples of the original problematic prompts and the improved versions, explaining the rationale behind the changes.

[ ] Future Enhancements (Bonus Points):

[ ] Briefly describe the Queue Worker Model (e.g., Redis Queue, Celery) and its benefits for concurrency.

[ ] Briefly describe Database Integration and its benefits for data storage and user management.
6. Bonus Point Implementation (Optional)
6.1. Queue Worker Model (e.g., Redis Queue)
[ ] Install Redis server (if not already available).

[ ] Add redis and rq to requirements.txt and install them.

[ ] Modify main.py:

[ ] Import Queue from rq.

[ ] Initialize a Redis Queue instance.

[ ] In the analyze_blood_report endpoint, instead of directly calling run_crew, enqueue the task to the Redis queue.

[ ] Return a response immediately with a job ID.

[ ] Create a new file, worker.py:

[ ] Import necessary functions (run_crew).

[ ] Set up an rq worker to listen to the queue and execute jobs.

[ ] (Optional) Implement an endpoint in main.py to check job status or retrieve results from Redis.

6.2. Database Integration (e.g., SQLite/SQLAlchemy)
[ ] Add sqlalchemy and sqlite3 (if not built-in) to requirements.txt and install them.

[ ] Define SQLAlchemy models for AnalysisResult (e.g., id, query, analysis_text, file_name, timestamp).

[ ] Initialize a database engine and session in a separate module (e.g., database.py).

[ ] Modify run_crew or create a new function to persist the analysis result to the database after successful processing.

[ ] (Optional) Implement endpoints in main.py to retrieve historical analysis results from the database.

7. Final Testing and Validation
[ ] Run the application and perform end-to-end testing with various PDF inputs (valid, invalid, different content).

[ ] Verify that all deterministic bugs are resolved and no new runtime errors are introduced.

[ ] Confirm that the AI agents provide accurate, professional, and helpful responses based on the optimized prompts.

[ ] Review the updated README.md for clarity, completeness, and accuracy.

[ ] If bonus points were implemented, test the asynchronous job submission/status and database persistence.
